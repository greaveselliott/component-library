- [ ] Assemble pages
- [ ] Fix all project linting errors
- [ ] Add visual regression tests
- [ ] Add Storybook Accessibility extension
- [ ] Remove FontAwesome dependency, in favor of explicit Icon component
      **Why remove FontAwesome?**
  1. Performance: FontAwesome comes with hundreds of icons most of which will be unusued (wasted file size)
  2. A smaller prescriptive icon set is more useful than a large icon set without any guidance.
- [ ] Move test script from component library package to root.
